# hello-world
no fear, i am here
I enjoy long walks on the beac.....nah screw all that! I love playing video games, watching anime and watching movies,sometimes. People should really try to be more truthful about themselves instead of hiding behind lies. The times have to such an extent that people have to be fake all the time...its quite sad.
